1.  Start with the pile of unsorted books.

2.  Find the book that comes first alphabetically in the pile:

    a. Start by picking the first book from the pile and set it aside as the "current first book."

    b. For each remaining book in the pile, do the following:

        i. Compare the first letter of the title of the "current first book" with the first letter of the next book in the pile.

            - If the first letter of the next book comes before the first letter of the current first book in alphabetical order, make this next book the new "current first book."

            - If the first letter of the next book comes after the first letter of the current first book, keep the current first book.

        ii. If the first letters are the same, compare the second letter of both books:

            - If the second letter of the next book comes before the second letter of the current first book, make this next book the new "current first book."

            - If the second letter comes after, keep the current first book.

        iii. Repeat this comparison between each pair of letters for each book until you find the first difference between the book titles.

    c. Repeat this process until you have compared all books in the pile.

    d. After checking all the books, the "current first book" is the one that comes first alphabetically.

3.  Move this book to a new pile for sorted books.

4.  Repeat steps 2 and 3 until no books are left in the unsorted pile.

5.  The new pile of books now contains all the books in alphabetical order.
