# CS571-FA24: Discussion E

In this discussion, you will write pseudocode to instruct another student on how to sort a pile of books in alphabetical order. Unfortunately, you do not know the specific books that the student is sorting! You must make your instructions general enough to work for any number of books, but specific enough that the student does not get confused. Please write your pseudocode in `pseudocode.md`

## Submission

There are two ways to submit your pseudocode: by Git and by Canvas. Please try to submit via Git; if the discussion deadline is soon and Git isn't working, please see "Submission via Canvas". **In either case, please be sure to respond to another student.** See "Response" for details.

### Submission via Git

When you are done with your pseudocode, be sure to save your `pseudocode.md` file! Then, use the following commands to submit your code to GitHub...

To add all of your changes...

```bash
git add -A
```

To view the changes about to be committed...

```bash
git commit -m "my pseudocode!"
```

To push the changes to GitHub...

```bash
git push
```

Your pseudocode should now be visible on GitHub! :)

If you need credentials to perform your `git push`, you may need a [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens)

In your Canvas discussion post, simply paste a link to your GitHub repository (e.g. [https://github.com/CS272-FA24/dis-e-ctnelson1997](https://github.com/CS272-FA24/dis-e-ctnelson1997))

### Submission via Canvas

Can't get Git working and the discussion deadline is tonight? Please just paste your pseudocode into the Canvas Discussion post. Then, visit office hours soon to sort out any Git issues -- we'll be using it again in HW5!

## Response

After submitting your pseudocode, go to the Canvas Discussion board and find another student's pseudocode. Then, respond with *constructive criticism* about potential pitfalls or ways to improve their pseudocode. Your response can simply be through a Canvas Discussion reply.

Congrats! You're done with DIS E.
